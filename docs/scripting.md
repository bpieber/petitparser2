# <a id="sec:scripting" />Extracting Javascript: scripting with bounded seas

In this chapter we extract javascript from html files using a simple script.
<!-- We create the real parser *later>chapter2.pillar*. -->

## Hands On 
Open your playground and let's start coding. 
First of all, we define what we want to parse:

```
source := PP2Sources current htmlSample.
```

The source very simplified (and slightly modified) version of *Wikipedia>wikipedia.org* and contains the following text:
<!-- PP2Sources current htmlSample -->
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- saved from url=(0026)https://www.wikipedia.org/ -->
<html lang="mul" dir="ltr" class="js-enabled">
<head>
	<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
	<title>Wikipedia</title>
	<meta name="description" content="Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia, created and edited by volunteers around the world and hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation.">
	<!--[if gt IE 7]-->
	<script>document.documentElement.className = document.documentElement.className.replace( /(^|\s)no-js(\s|$)/, "$1js-enabled$2" );</script>
	<!--[endif]-->
</head>
<body id="www-wikipedia-org">
	<h1 class="central-textlogo" style="font-variant: small-caps" alt="WikipediA" title="Wikipedia">
		<img src="./Wikipedia_files/Wikipedia_wordmark.png" srcset="portal/wikipedia.org/assets/img/Wikipedia_wordmark@1.5x.png 1.5x" width="174" height="30" alt="WikipediA" title="Wikipedia">
		<strong id="js-localized-slogan" class="localized-slogan" style="visibility: visible;">The Free Encyclopedia</strong>
	</h1>
	<div id="mydiv">
		Hi there!
	</div>
	<script>alert("All scripts ends with: '</script>'...")</script>
	<!-- <p>obsolete conentent</p> -->
</body>
</html>
```

Second, we define javascript as a ```js``` rule:

```smalltalk
js := '<script>' asPParser, #any asPParser starLazy flatten, '</script>' asPParser 
	==> #second.
```

The ```starLazy``` operator is a new feature of PetitParser2.
It repetitively invokes the given parser (any character in this case) until a string recognized by the following parser (*</script>* in this case) appears. 
The ```starLazy``` operator is unique because you donâ€™t need to specify the following parser, it is inferred automatically based on the grammar. 
And with any change in the grammar, the ```starLazy``` updates itself.

{% include note.html content="
If you want to define the same rule in the previous version of PetitParser, it would be:
```smalltalk
'<script>' asParser, (#any asParser starLazy: '</script>' asParser) flatten, '</script>' asParser.
```
" %}

Let us try if the ```javascript``` rule can parse our ```source```:

```smalltalk
js parse: source.
```

The result is failure. 
Inspect the failure and switch to *Debug View*. Notice that *\<script\>* is expected at the beginning of a file, but input starts with *<!DOCTYPE html>*. 

<img src="/img/scripting-failure.png" alt="Scripting Failure">

To fix it, create a new rule ```jsSea```: a javascript island in a sea of an uninteresting water, using the ```sea``` operator:

```smalltalk
jsSea := js sea ==> #second.
jsSea parse: source.
```

{% include note.html content="
The ```sea``` operator does some magic and the result is not a failure! 
Sea returns an array of three elements: 
1. before-water 
1. island and 
1. after-water

Island is the result of the javascript rule. 
Before and after water contain the rest of an input (and today we are not interested in it) so we drop the water using ```js sea ==> #second```, which returns only island.
" %}


Looks better, but we are missing some results! 
This is because we never specified that there could be multiple occurrences of javascript (i.e. of ```jsSea``` rule). 
We can easily add more ```jsSea``` rules by defining a ```document``` rule:

```smalltalk
document := jsSea star.
```

The whole script looks like: 
<!-- PP2Tutorial new sourceForScript: #scriptWithoutString. -->
```smalltalk
source := PP2Sources current htmlSample.
js := '<script>' asPParser, #any asPParser starLazy flatten, '</script>' asPParser
	==> #second.
jsSea := js sea ==> #second.
document := jsSea star.
```

Now by calling ```document parse: source``` we extract both javascripts from the source, the result should look like: 

<img src="/img/scripting-result.png" alt="Scripting Result">

<!--
tutorial := PP2Tutorial new.
(tutorial scriptWithoutString parse: tutorial source) first.
(tutorial scriptWithoutString parse: tutorial source) second.
-->
1. ```document.documentElement.className = document.documentElement.className.replace( /(^|\s)no-js(\s|$)/, "$1js-enabled$2" );```
1. ```alert("All scripts ends with: ' ```

There is something fishy about the second result. 
The second javascript ended prematurely!
It should look like this:

<!--
tutorial := PP2Tutorial new.
(tutorial script parse: tutorial source) second.
-->

```javascript
alert("All scripts ends with: '</script>'...")
```

It is ended prematurely, because the javascript rule ```js``` as we defined it does not know about strings. 
Therefore, the javascript rule thinks that there is a closing of the script tag even though it is a part of the alert message string. 
We can fix it by defining javascript strings and redefining the ```js``` rule:

<!-- 
PP2Tutorial new sourceForScript: #script.
-->
```smalltalk
any := #any asPParser.
jsString := $' asPParser, any starLazy, $' asPParser.
js := '<script>' asPParser, ((jsString / any) starLazy) flatten, '</script>' asPParser
	 ==> #second.
```

Great, everything works as expected!

<!--
tutorial := PP2Tutorial new.
(tutorial script parse: tutorial source) first.
(tutorial script parse: tutorial source) second.
-->

1. ```document.documentElement.className = document.documentElement.className.replace( /(^|\s)no-js(\s|$)/, "$1js-enabled$2" );```
1. ```alert("All scripts ends with: '</script>'...")```


{% include note.html content="
If you think that what we did today can be done with a regular expression, you are absolutely right.
Nevertheless, this is just a first step, PetitParser2 will boldly go where no regular expression has gone before.
" %}

## Summary
We prototyped a parser to extract javascript from html files.
In the PetitParser2, there are ```sea``` and ```starLazy``` operators to help us skip an uninteresting input.
